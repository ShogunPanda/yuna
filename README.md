## Install

Download one of the prebuilt binaries for your platform, then make it executable:

- [Linux](https://github.com/ShogunPanda/yuna/releases/latest/download/yuna-linux)
- [macOS (Intel)](https://github.com/ShogunPanda/yuna/releases/latest/download/yuna-macos-intel)
- [macOS (Apple M1)](https://github.com/ShogunPanda/yuna/releases/latest/download/yuna-macos-arm)
- [Windows](https://github.com/ShogunPanda/yuna/releases/latest/download/yuna.exe)

Example:

```sh
curl -L -o yuna https://github.com/ShogunPanda/yuna/releases/latest/download/yuna-linux
chmod a+x yuna
```

## Install (other platforms)

If your platform is not available or you don't want to use the binaries above, make sure you have a Rust installation locally, then run:

```sh
cargo install yuna
```

## Usage

```sh
# If run without arguments, it will list all available variables in that folder.
yuna

# If run with more than an argument, it will write a variable,
yuna foo bar baz

# If run with a argument, it will read a variable.
yuna foo
```

Every time a variable is saved, a `.yuna.yml`Â is created in the current directory. When searching all available variables, yuna will search and load all `.yuna.yml` files in all ancestors folders, up to `/`.

- Fork the project
- Start a feature/bugfix branch
- Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
- Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
