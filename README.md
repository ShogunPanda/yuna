# yuna

<!-- TODO@PI: Add badges -->

Naive terminal variables manager.

https://sw.cowtech.it/yuna

## Install

<!-- TODO@PI: Release binaries for the same platform of Fishaminum, plus Mac M1, using GitHub Actions no local install is necessary -->

Make sure you have a Rust installation locally, then run:

```sh
cargo install yuna
```

## Usage

```sh
# If run without arguments, it will list all available variables in that folder.
yuna

# If run with more than an argument, it will write a variable
yuna foo bar baz

# If run with a argument, it will read a variable
yuna foo
```

Every time a variable is saved, a `.yuna.yml`Â is created in the current directory. When searching all available variables, yuna will search and load all `.yuna.yml` files in all ancestors folders, up to `/`.

## Contributing to yuna

- Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
- Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
- Fork the project
- Start a feature/bugfix branch
- Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
- Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
